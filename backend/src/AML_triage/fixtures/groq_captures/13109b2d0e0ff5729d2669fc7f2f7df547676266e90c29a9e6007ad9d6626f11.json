    "explanation": "The combination of missing Source of Funds (SOF) information and complex Anti-Money Laundering (AML) risk indicators, coupled with a high corridor risk, necessitates a Suspicious (SUS) decision. This triggers a series of actions to mitigate potential AML risks, including case creation, requesting SOF documents, placing a soft hold on the transaction, escalating to Level 2 AML for review, sending a brief to the Risk Manager, and requesting customer documentation to verify the legitimacy of the transaction."
