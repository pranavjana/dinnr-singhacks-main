**Executive Summary**
The case has been flagged due to a failed decision with an unspecified risk level, necessitating further review and potential reporting. The recommended action path involves preparing a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) draft, placing a temporary soft hold on the account, and escalating the case to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis. These actions aim to gather more evidence, prevent potential suspicious activity, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Recommended Actions**
* Prepare a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) draft (Action ID: FILE_STR_DRAFT) by populating the template with transaction chronology and customer explanation, attaching supporting evidence, and scheduling a review with the MLRO.
* Place a temporary soft hold (Action ID: PLACE_SOFT_HOLD) on the account to prevent further outbound activity, ensuring no critical payments are blocked and notifying the relationship manager.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for deeper analysis, submitting a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting looming deadlines.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions were considered, as the recommended actions are essential for ensuring compliance and gathering more evidence. However, the reviewer should be prepared to adapt the approach based on new information or changes in the case circumstances.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the failed decision and unspecified risk level justify the recommended actions. The reviewer should carefully review the case details and consider any potential risks or suspicious activity when preparing the STR draft and escalating the case.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for any updates or new information, follow up with the MLRO and relationship manager as needed, and ensure that all outstanding evidence is collected and documented. The reviewer should also verify that the soft hold is lifted or extended as necessary and that the STR draft is submitted on time. Outstanding evidence required includes the transaction chronology, customer explanation, and supporting documentation. The reviewer should schedule a review with the MLRO before the statutory deadline and ensure that all legal entity identifiers and dates are accurate.
