**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 28368635-4c99-4b87-8606-9bac6830aee3 has been flagged for further review due to a screening decision of SUS, indicating potential suspicious activity. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshot, a thorough investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the transactions. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, including updating the CaseWorks record, attaching relevant evidence, and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for further analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template, logging the outreach, and setting a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary objective is to gather more information and context about the flagged transactions. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may be flagged for further escalation.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the screening decision of SUS indicates potential suspicious activity, justifying the need for a thorough investigation.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, including the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request. A follow-up review is recommended within 10 business days to assess the progress of the investigation. Outstanding evidence required includes the customer's source-of-funds documentation and any additional information that may be requested by the Level 2 AML analyst during the escalation process.
