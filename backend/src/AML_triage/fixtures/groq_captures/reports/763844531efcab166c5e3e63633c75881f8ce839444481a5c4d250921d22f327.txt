**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 8db97f93-e0ab-4ec1-9814-40cd1c66665f has been flagged for further review due to a screening decision of SUS, indicating potential suspicious activity. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction context, a cautious approach is recommended. The suggested action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These steps aim to gather more information and assess the risk associated with the flagged transactions.

**Recommended Actions:**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, ensuring the case references the current trace ID and screening decision.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for further analysis, submitting a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template and logging the outreach in the case journal, with a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Considerations**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary goal is to gather more information about the flagged transactions. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may need to be escalated further.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the screening decision of SUS indicates potential suspicious activity, justifying the recommended actions to gather more information and assess the risk.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and follow up within 5 business days if no response is received. The reviewer should also verify that the case is properly updated in the internal case management system and that the escalation to the Level 2 AML analyst is completed. Outstanding evidence required includes the customer's source-of-funds documentation and any additional information that may be requested by the Level 2 AML analyst during their review.
