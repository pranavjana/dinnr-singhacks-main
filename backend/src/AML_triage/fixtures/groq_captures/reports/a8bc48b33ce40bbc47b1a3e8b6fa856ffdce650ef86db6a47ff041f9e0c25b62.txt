**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 2d4c18de-8924-40e3-9f84-8387cbb6e88e has been flagged for further investigation due to its suspicious nature, warranting a comprehensive review to determine the legitimacy of the transactions. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating it to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These steps are crucial in gathering more information to assess the risk level and make an informed decision.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, ensuring all relevant evidence and transaction notes are attached and the case is assigned to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for specialist review, providing a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines for prioritization.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer using the pre-approved template, logging the outreach and setting a reminder to follow up within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Considerations**
No alternative actions have been identified at this stage, as the primary focus is on gathering more information through the recommended actions. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may need to be escalated further, and additional actions may be considered.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context have been provided, the suspicious nature of the case warrants a thorough investigation to determine the origin of funds and assess the risk level.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, follow up with the customer within 5 business days if no response is received, and review the case again after the Level 2 AML analyst's assessment. Outstanding evidence required includes source-of-funds documentation and any additional information that may be requested by the Level 2 analyst. The reviewer should also verify that the case references the current trace ID and screening decision and confirm the customer has not already submitted acceptable source-of-funds documentation in the past 90 days.
