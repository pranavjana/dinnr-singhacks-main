**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 7c4fa2c0-bdd7-43ab-8cae-806ea850f701 has been flagged for further investigation due to its suspicious nature, warranting a comprehensive review to determine the legitimacy of the transactions involved. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating it to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These steps are crucial in gathering more information and assessing the risk associated with the transactions.

**Recommended Actions**
* **Create Investigation Case (CREATE_CASE)**: Create or update the CaseWorks record with the latest alert context and transaction notes, and assign the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* **Escalate to Level 2 AML Analyst (ESCALATE_L2_AML)**: Submit the escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions, highlighting any looming deadlines for prioritisation.
* **Request Source-of-Funds Documentation (REQUEST_SOF_DOCS)**: Send the pre-approved SOF customer request template and log the outreach in the case journal, setting a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Considerations**
No alternative actions have been identified at this stage, as the primary focus is on gathering more information through the recommended actions. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may need to be escalated further, potentially involving more severe measures such as filing a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR).

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context have been provided, the suspicious nature of the case warrants a thorough investigation to determine the legitimacy of the transactions and assess the associated risk.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, particularly the response from the customer regarding the source-of-funds documentation. A follow-up review is recommended within 10 business days to assess the progress of the investigation and determine if further actions are required. Outstanding evidence includes the customer's response to the SOF request and any additional information gathered during the investigation.
