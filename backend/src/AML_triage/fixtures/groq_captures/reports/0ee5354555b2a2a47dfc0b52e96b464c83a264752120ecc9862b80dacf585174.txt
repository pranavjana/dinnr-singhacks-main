**Executive Summary**
The customer, Lee Aaron, has been flagged for a potentially high-risk transaction involving an outbound payment of $12,750 USD to Okoye Trading in Nigeria. The transaction is suspicious due to the rapid movement of funds, with seven prior inbound credits followed by an outbound transfer within 24-36 hours. The corridor from Singapore to Nigeria is also on the FATF high-risk list. Given the customer's previous warnings about source-of-funds documentation gaps, it is essential to request updated documentation to understand the origin of the funds.

**Recommended Actions**
To address the potential risks associated with this transaction, the following actions are recommended:
* **REQUEST_SOF_DOCS**: Request source-of-funds documentation from the customer to understand the origin of the funds. This action is relevant as it will provide essential information to assess the legitimacy of the transaction. According to the playbook, the pre-approved SOF customer request template should be sent to the customer, and the outreach should be logged in the case journal with a reminder to chase within 5 business days. No approvals are required for this action.
* **CREATE_CASE**: Create an investigation case to track the alert within the internal case management system. This action is necessary to ensure that the case is properly documented and assigned to the appropriate investigation queue. The playbook requires verifying that the case references the current trace ID and screening decision, and no approvals are required.
* **PLACE_SOFT_HOLD**: Consider placing a temporary soft hold on the customer's account to prevent further outbound activity while the investigation gathers more evidence. This action is relevant as it will prevent potential money laundering activities. However, it requires Compliance/MLRO approval prior to execution, and the playbook requires ensuring that no critical payments will be blocked.

**Monitoring and Contingencies**
To ensure the effective implementation of the recommended actions, the following monitoring items and contingencies should be considered:
* If the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete source-of-funds documentation, the case should be escalated to the next level of review.
* If the soft hold is placed, a review reminder should be set before the hold expires to ensure that the investigation is completed or the hold is lifted.
* The customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request should be monitored, and additional questions on transaction purpose may be required.
* The case should be reviewed regularly to ensure that all necessary documentation is collected, and the investigation is progressing as expected.

**Next Steps**
The next steps will depend on the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and the outcome of the investigation. If the customer provides satisfactory documentation, the case may be closed, and the soft hold lifted. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete documentation, the case may need to be escalated to the next level of review, and additional actions may be required.
