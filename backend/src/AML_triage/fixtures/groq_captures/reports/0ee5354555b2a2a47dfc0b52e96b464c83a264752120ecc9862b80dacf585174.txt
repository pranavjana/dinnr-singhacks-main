**Executive Summary**
The customer, Lee Aaron, has been flagged for a potentially high-risk transaction involving an outbound payment of $12,750 USD to Okoye Trading in Nigeria. The transaction is suspicious due to the rapid movement of funds, with seven prior inbound credits followed by an outbound transfer within 24-36 hours. The corridor from Singapore to Nigeria is also on the FATF high-risk list. Given the customer's previous warnings about source-of-funds documentation gaps, it is essential to request updated documentation to understand the origin of the funds.

**Recommended Actions**
To address the potential risks associated with this transaction, the following actions are recommended:
* **REQUEST_SOF_DOCS**: Request source-of-funds documentation from the customer to understand the origin of the funds. This action is relevant as it will provide essential information to assess the legitimacy of the transaction. According to the playbook, the pre-approved SOF customer request template should be sent to the customer, and the outreach should be logged in the case journal with a reminder to chase within 5 business days. No approvals are required for this action.
* **CREATE_CASE**: Create an investigation case to track the alert within the internal case management system. This action is necessary to ensure that all relevant information is documented and easily accessible. The playbook requires creating or updating the CaseWorks record with the latest alert context and transaction notes, attaching relevant evidence, and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue. No approvals are required for this action.
* **PLACE_SOFT_HOLD**: Consider placing a temporary soft hold on the customer's account to prevent further outbound activity while the investigation gathers more evidence. This action is relevant as it will prevent potential money laundering activities. However, it requires Compliance/MLRO approval prior to execution. The playbook requires submitting the soft hold instruction through the account controls tool with the default 72-hour duration and notifying the relationship manager.

**Monitoring and Contingencies**
To ensure the effective implementation of the recommended actions, the following monitoring items and contingencies should be considered:
* If the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete source-of-funds documentation, the case should be escalated to the next level of review.
* If the soft hold is placed, a review reminder should be set before the hold expires to ensure that the investigation is completed or the hold is lifted.
* The customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request should be monitored, and any additional questions or concerns should be addressed promptly.
* The case should be reviewed regularly to ensure that all necessary actions are being taken and that the investigation is progressing as expected.

**Additional Considerations**
Based on the customer's previous warnings about source-of-funds documentation gaps, it is essential to closely monitor their response to the documentation request. If the customer is uncooperative or provides incomplete information, it may be necessary to escalate the case to the next level of review or consider filing a suspicious transaction report. The relationship manager should be informed of the investigation status and any interim controls, and the customer should be advised on the necessary next steps to resolve the issue.
