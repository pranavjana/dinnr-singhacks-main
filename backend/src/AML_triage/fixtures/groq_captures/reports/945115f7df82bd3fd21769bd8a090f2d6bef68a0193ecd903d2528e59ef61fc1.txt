**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 1732031d-e51f-4426-abc7-87c06bada650 has been flagged for further investigation due to an unspecified risk level and a screening decision of SUS. To proceed, we recommend creating an investigation case, escalating it to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These actions will ensure the alert is properly tracked, thoroughly analyzed, and supported by relevant evidence.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, including updating the CaseWorks record, attaching relevant evidence, and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for deeper analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template, logging the outreach, and setting a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary objective is to gather more information and conduct a thorough analysis. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may be flagged for further escalation.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the unspecified risk level and screening decision of SUS justify the recommended actions to ensure a thorough investigation.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, follow up on the source-of-funds documentation request within 5 business days, and verify that the case is properly tracked within the internal case management system. Outstanding evidence required includes the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and any additional information gathered during the Level 2 analysis. The reviewer should schedule a follow-up review to assess the case's progress and determine the next course of action.
