**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID fedcd0e2-794b-4598-b9c2-a599c65be8e4 has been flagged for further review due to a screening decision of SUS, indicating potential suspicious activity. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshot, a thorough investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the transactions. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, including updating the CaseWorks record, attaching relevant evidence, and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for specialist review, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template, logging the outreach, and setting a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Deprioritisation**
No alternative actions have been identified, as the provided information does not suggest any other viable paths. The recommended actions are prioritised due to the potential suspicious nature of the transactions and the need for further analysis.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context have been provided, the screening decision of SUS indicates a potential risk that warrants further investigation. The recommended actions aim to gather more information and context to determine the legitimacy of the transactions.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, particularly the response to the source-of-funds documentation request. A follow-up review is recommended within 10 business days to assess the customer's response and determine the next course of action. Outstanding evidence required includes the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and any additional information gathered during the investigation.
