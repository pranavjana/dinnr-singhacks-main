**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID e7b3e6bf-7f5e-400c-9eb6-d3b13d320ba4 has been flagged with a decision of SUS, indicating a potential suspicious activity that requires further investigation. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshot, it is essential to create an investigation case, escalate to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and request source-of-funds documentation to gather more information. The recommended actions will help determine the legitimacy of the transactions and ensure compliance with AML regulations.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, attaching relevant evidence and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (ESCALATE_L2_AML) for deeper analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer to collect documentary evidence explaining the origin of funds for the flagged transactions.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary goal is to gather more information about the transactions and the customer. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may need to be escalated further or additional actions taken.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the SUS decision indicates a potential suspicious activity that requires further investigation. The recommended actions will help identify potential risk signals and provide context for the transactions.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, follow up with the customer within 5 business days if necessary, and review the case again after receiving the source-of-funds documentation. The reviewer should also verify that the case references the current trace ID and screening decision. Outstanding evidence required includes the source-of-funds documentation and any additional information provided by the customer. A follow-up review is recommended within 10 business days to assess the progress of the investigation and determine the next course of action.
