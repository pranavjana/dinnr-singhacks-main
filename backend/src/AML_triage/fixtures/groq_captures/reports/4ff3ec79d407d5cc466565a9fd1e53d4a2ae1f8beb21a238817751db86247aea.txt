**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID d328abe9-de0a-4dca-9a7c-e0d9e96b016e has been flagged for further investigation due to a screening decision of SUS (Suspicious), warranting a comprehensive review to determine the legitimacy of the transactions. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating it to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These steps are necessary to gather more information and assess the risk associated with the transactions.

**Recommended Actions:**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, ensuring the case references the current trace ID and screening decision.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for specialist review, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template and logging the outreach in the case journal.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary objective is to gather more information and conduct a thorough analysis of the transactions. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may be flagged for further escalation.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the screening decision of SUS indicates a potential risk that warrants further investigation. The recommended actions are designed to mitigate this risk by gathering more information and conducting a comprehensive analysis.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and follow up within 5 business days if no response is received. The reviewer should also verify that the case is properly updated in the internal case management system and that all relevant evidence is attached. Outstanding evidence includes the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and any additional information that may be required to complete the investigation. A follow-up review is recommended within 10 business days to assess the progress of the investigation and determine if further action is required.
