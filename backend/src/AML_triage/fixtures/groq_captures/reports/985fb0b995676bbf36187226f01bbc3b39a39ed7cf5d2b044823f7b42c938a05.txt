**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID c84d0629-f643-4e3c-9d11-1cce54518b47 has been flagged due to an unspecified risk level and a decision to fail, indicating potential suspicious activity. The recommended action path involves preparing a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) draft, placing a temporary soft hold on the account, and escalating the case to a Level 2 AML analyst for further review. These actions are necessary to gather more evidence, prevent potential outbound activity, and ensure a thorough analysis of the case.

**Recommended Actions**
* Prepare a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) draft (Action ID: FILE_STR_DRAFT) by populating the template with transaction chronology and customer explanation, attaching supporting evidence, and scheduling a review with the MLRO.
* Place a temporary soft hold on the account (Action ID: PLACE_SOFT_HOLD) to prevent further outbound activity, notifying the relationship manager and documenting the control rationale.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for deeper analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions were considered, as the recommended actions are standard procedures for handling potentially suspicious activity. However, the reviewer should be aware that other actions may be necessary depending on the outcome of the Level 2 analysis.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context were provided, the case's unspecified risk level and failed decision indicate a need for further investigation. The recommended actions will help gather more evidence and prevent potential outbound activity.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates from the Level 2 analyst and follow up with the MLRO regarding the STR draft review. The soft hold should be reviewed before the 72-hour duration expires to determine if it should be lifted or extended. Outstanding evidence, such as transaction chronology and customer explanation, should be collected and attached to the STR draft. The reviewer should also ensure that all legal entity identifiers and dates are accurate and that no critical payments will be blocked by the soft hold. A review reminder should be set before the hold expires to ensure timely follow-up.
