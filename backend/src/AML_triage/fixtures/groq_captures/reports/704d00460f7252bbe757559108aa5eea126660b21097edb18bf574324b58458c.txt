**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 36c0f019-7112-4f08-abac-da4eee6d3848 has been flagged for further review due to an unspecified risk level and a screening decision of SUS. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshots, it is essential to create an investigation case, escalate to a Level 2 AML analyst, and request source-of-funds documentation to gather more information and assess the risk. The recommended actions will ensure that the alert is thoroughly tracked and analyzed, and the necessary evidence is collected to support the investigation.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, including updating the CaseWorks record, attaching relevant evidence, and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for deeper analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) to collect documentary evidence explaining the origin of funds for the flagged transactions, sending a pre-approved customer request template and logging the outreach in the case journal.

**Alternative Actions and Deprioritization**
No alternative actions were considered, as the provided information does not suggest any other viable paths. The recommended actions are essential to gather more information and assess the risk associated with the flagged case.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the screening decision of SUS and the unspecified risk level justify the recommended actions to ensure a thorough investigation.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, including the response to the source-of-funds documentation request, and follow up within 5 business days if necessary. The reviewer should also verify that the case is properly tracked in the CaseWorks record and that the escalation to the Level 2 AML analyst is documented. Outstanding evidence includes the source-of-funds documentation and any additional information that may be required to support the investigation. The reviewer should schedule a follow-up review to assess the case status and determine if further actions are necessary.
