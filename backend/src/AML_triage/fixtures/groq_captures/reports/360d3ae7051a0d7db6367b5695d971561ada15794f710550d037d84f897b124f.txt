**Executive Summary**
The case a4e632f9-9e25-4645-9b5e-485b50a6ce3a has been flagged with a decision of SUS, indicating a potential suspicious activity that requires further investigation. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshot, it is essential to create an investigation case, escalate to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and request source-of-funds documentation to gather more information. The recommended actions will help determine the legitimacy of the transactions and ensure compliance with AML regulations.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, including updating the CaseWorks record, attaching relevant evidence, and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for further analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template, logging the outreach, and setting a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Deprioritization**
No alternative actions were considered, as the provided information is insufficient to determine the best course of action. However, if additional information becomes available, alternative actions may be explored.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the SUS decision indicates a potential suspicious activity that requires further investigation. The recommended actions will help gather more information to determine the legitimacy of the transactions.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, follow up on the source-of-funds documentation request within 5 business days, and review the case journal for any new information. Outstanding evidence includes the source-of-funds documentation and any additional information provided by the customer or the Level 2 AML analyst. The reviewer should also verify that the case references the current trace ID and screening decision and confirm the customer has not already submitted acceptable source-of-funds documentation in the past 90 days.
