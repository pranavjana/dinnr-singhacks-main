**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID b0dea518-cd67-4752-9b79-7bd12b392b58 has been flagged for further investigation due to a screening decision of SUS (Suspicious), warranting a comprehensive review to determine the legitimacy of the transactions. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating it to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These steps are necessary to gather more information and assess the risk associated with the transactions.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, ensuring the case references the current trace ID and screening decision.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for specialist review, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template and logging the outreach in the case journal.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions have been identified in this case, as the recommended actions are standard procedures for investigating suspicious transactions. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may be flagged for further escalation.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context have been provided, the screening decision of SUS indicates a potential risk that warrants further investigation. The recommended actions will help gather more information to assess the risk associated with the transactions.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and follow up within 5 business days if no response is received. The reviewer should also verify that the case has been properly escalated to a Level 2 AML analyst and that the investigation case has been created with the latest alert context and transaction notes. Outstanding evidence required includes the customer's source-of-funds documentation and any additional information that may be requested by the Level 2 AML analyst during their review.
