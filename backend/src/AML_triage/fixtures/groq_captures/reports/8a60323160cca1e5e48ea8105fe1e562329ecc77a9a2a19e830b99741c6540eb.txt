**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID ec6e87d7-c908-4604-a57f-88c7167f0f0f has been flagged for further investigation due to its suspicious nature, despite lacking specific risk signals and transaction context. Given the uncertainty surrounding the case, it is recommended to create an investigation case, escalate it to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and request source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These actions will help gather more information and determine the legitimacy of the transactions.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, ensuring the case references the current trace ID and screening decision.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for further analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template and logging the outreach in the case journal.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary goal is to gather more information about the case. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may need to be escalated further.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the suspicious nature of the case warrants further investigation. The recommended actions will help identify potential risk signals and provide context for the transactions.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and follow up within 5 business days if necessary. The reviewer should also verify that the case is properly updated in the case management system and that the escalation request is submitted to the Level 2 AML analyst. Outstanding evidence required includes the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and any additional information gathered during the investigation. The reviewer should schedule a follow-up review in 10 business days to assess the progress of the case and determine if further actions are required.
