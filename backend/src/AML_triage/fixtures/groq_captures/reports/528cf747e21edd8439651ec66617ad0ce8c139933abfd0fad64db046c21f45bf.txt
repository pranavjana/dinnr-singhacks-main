**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 4db1b16c-2260-48ac-a8ce-fdd346de1469 has been flagged for further review due to a screening decision of SUS, indicating potential suspicious activity. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshot, a thorough investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the transactions. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, ensuring the case references the current trace ID and screening decision.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for specialist review, submitting a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template and logging the outreach in the case journal, with a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Deprioritisation**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary focus is on gathering more information to support the investigation. However, if the customer fails to respond or provides incomplete evidence, the case may be flagged for further escalation.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the screening decision of SUS indicates potential suspicious activity, justifying the recommended actions to gather more information and conduct a thorough investigation.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and follow up within 5 business days if no response is received. The reviewer should also verify that the case is properly updated in the internal case management system and that all relevant evidence is attached. Outstanding evidence includes the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and any additional information that may be required to support the investigation. A follow-up review is recommended within 10 business days to assess the progress of the investigation and determine if further actions are necessary.
