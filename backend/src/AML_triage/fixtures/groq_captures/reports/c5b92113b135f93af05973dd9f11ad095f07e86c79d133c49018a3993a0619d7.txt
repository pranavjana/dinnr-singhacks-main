**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID fd1d3bd5-dd0e-439a-989d-6a1d331caf75 has been flagged for further investigation due to a screening decision of SUS, indicating potential suspicious activity. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshots, a thorough investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the transactions. The recommended action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, including updating the CaseWorks record, attaching relevant evidence, and assigning the case to the appropriate investigation queue.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for further analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions, and highlighting any looming deadlines.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template, logging the outreach, and setting a reminder to chase within 5 business days.

**Alternative Actions and Risk Signals**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage, as the primary goal is to gather more information and context about the transactions. The lack of provided signals and transaction context justifies the need for a thorough investigation. The risk signals that would normally inform the recommendation are not available, emphasizing the importance of creating a case and escalating to a specialist for deeper analysis.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for updates, particularly the response from the customer regarding source-of-funds documentation. A follow-up review is recommended within 10 business days to assess the progress of the investigation. Outstanding evidence required includes transaction snapshots, analyst observations, and source-of-funds documentation from the customer. The reviewer should verify that the case references the current trace ID and screening decision, and confirm the customer has not already submitted acceptable source-of-funds documentation in the past 90 days.
