**Executive Summary**
The case with Trace ID 09f60d93-2618-4861-8eaf-d3d1888060e9 has been flagged due to its high-risk nature, warranting a comprehensive review and potential reporting to the relevant authorities. The recommended action path involves preparing a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) draft, placing a temporary soft hold on the account, and escalating the case to a Level 2 AML analyst for further analysis. These actions are necessary to prevent potential money laundering activities and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Recommended Actions**
* **Prepare Suspicious Transaction Report Draft (FILE_STR_DRAFT)**: Compile facts and rationale needed for MLRO STR evaluation, ensuring all legal entity identifiers and dates are accurate, and obtain MLRO approval before submission.
* **Place Temporary Soft Hold (PLACE_SOFT_HOLD)**: Prevent further outbound activity while the investigation gathers more evidence, ensuring no critical payments are blocked, and obtain Compliance/MLRO approval prior to execution.
* **Escalate to Level 2 AML Analyst (ESCALATE_L2_AML)**: Route the complex case to a specialist reviewer for deeper analysis, confirming the L2 queue capacity or identifying a named analyst if required by SOP.

**Alternative Actions and Rationale**
No alternative actions were considered, as the recommended actions are essential for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and preventing potential money laundering activities.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context were provided, the case's high-risk nature and the need for a comprehensive review justify the recommended actions.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case's progress, ensuring that the STR draft is completed and submitted to the MLRO for approval, the soft hold is implemented and reviewed before expiration, and the escalation to the Level 2 AML analyst is completed. The reviewer should follow up on the case within 72 hours to ensure that all actions are being taken and that no critical payments are being blocked. Outstanding evidence required includes the transaction chronology, customer explanation (if any), and supporting documentation.
