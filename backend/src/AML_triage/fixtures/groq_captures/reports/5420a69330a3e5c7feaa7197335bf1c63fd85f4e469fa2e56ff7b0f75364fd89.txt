**Executive Summary**
The case a9f7567f-57c9-45c9-90a0-e65a3df49b4b has been flagged with a decision of SUS, indicating a need for further investigation. Given the lack of provided signals, profile considerations, and transaction snapshot, a cautious approach is recommended. The suggested action path involves creating an investigation case, escalating to a Level 2 AML analyst for deeper analysis, and requesting source-of-funds documentation from the customer. These steps aim to gather more information and context to assess the risk level accurately.

**Recommended Actions**
* Create an investigation case (Action ID: CREATE_CASE) to track the alert within the internal case management system, ensuring the case references the current trace ID and screening decision.
* Escalate the case to a Level 2 AML analyst (Action ID: ESCALATE_L2_AML) for a more in-depth analysis, submitting an escalation request with a summary of detected patterns and open questions.
* Request source-of-funds documentation (Action ID: REQUEST_SOF_DOCS) from the customer, sending a pre-approved template and logging the outreach in the case journal.

**Alternative Actions and Considerations**
No alternative actions are recommended at this stage due to the insufficient information provided. However, the reviewer should be prepared to adapt the approach based on the outcome of the recommended actions, particularly the response from the customer regarding source-of-funds documentation.

**Risk Signals and Transaction Context**
Although no specific risk signals or transaction context are provided, the SUS decision indicates a potential risk that warrants further investigation. The actions recommended are designed to gather more information to justify the risk level and determine the appropriate course of action.

**Next Steps**
The reviewer should monitor the case for the customer's response to the source-of-funds documentation request and follow up within 5 business days if necessary. The reviewer should also track the progress of the escalation to the Level 2 AML analyst and be prepared to provide additional information or context as required. Outstanding evidence includes the customer's response to the source-of-funds request and any additional documentation or analysis provided by the Level 2 AML analyst. A follow-up review is recommended once the customer's response is received or the escalation is completed to reassess the case and determine further actions.
