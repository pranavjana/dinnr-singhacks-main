{"verdict":"suspicious","risk_score":72,"justification":"Transaction exhibits multiple red-flags: (1) Narrative is semantically incoherent, typical of AI-generated text used to obfuscate purpose; (2) Cross-border movement of >25 k EUR from a high-risk jurisdiction (CN) to another high-risk jurisdiction (TH) via a third-party high-speed channel (FAST SG) with no clear economic rationale; (3) Purpose code “LEA” (Legal Expenses/Advocacy) is inconsistent with personal remittance and rarely used for large consumer transfers; (4) No prior customer history or supporting documentation uploaded; (5) Name similarity hits for Shaun Dawson with PEP media adverse news (low-confidence).
